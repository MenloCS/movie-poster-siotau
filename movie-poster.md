# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- **Movie Title:**  The Last Samurai
- **Why I chose this movie:**  I like action and this movie

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:**  Tragic, Tension

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element:**  Main character of this movie on horse with other samurai in background
- **Why this element:**  I want the poster to show them in battle

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid:**  I do not want it to be too tragic but just have a feeling of tragedy. I want the name of the movie to be on the poster but not too attracting.

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s):**  Orange, Red, Black
- **Accent color(s):**  Green, White
- **Overall mood:** warm and muted

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)  
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  
- [X] Medium shot (full figure)  
- [ ] Object/symbol centered  
- [ ] Character collage  

- **Focal point description:**  I want the main character to be the main focus

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make me a movie poster of "The Last Samurai" movie. I want to make a feeling of tragedy and tension. I want the main character to be riding a white horse with samurai armor on and with other samurai behind him also riding horses. They should be in battle. I do not want it to be too tragic but just have a feeling of tragedy. I want the name of the movie to be on the poster but not too attracting. The overall mood should be warm and muted.

- **What worked:**  The samurai looks really cool
- **What didn't work:**  I kind of wanted there to be grass in the background
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  I will tell it to add grass

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make me a movie poster of "The Last Samurai" movie. I want to make a feeling of tragedy and tension. I want the main character to be riding a white horse with red samurai armor on and with other samurai behind him also riding horses. They should be in battle. I do not want it to be too tragic but just have a feeling of tragedy. I want the name of the movie to be on the poster. The overall mood should be warm and muted. The characters should be riding up a green hill. The camera view should be from the side of the main guy samurai. Make the image realistic and the main samurai should look western while the other samurai should look like tough asian samurai.

- **What worked:**  I liked how the samurai looked, and the fact that the colors that I wanted were there
- **What didn't work:**  some of the images looked too cartoonish and too bright.
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  I will tell it to make it more intense in battle and make the sky a bit darker

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:**  Make me a movie poster of "The Last Samurai" movie. I want to make it feel tragic and tense. I want the main character to be riding a white horse with red samurai armor on and with other samurai behind him also riding horses. They should be in battle. I want the name of the movie to be on the poster. The overall mood should be warm and muted. The characters should be riding up a hill with the samurais in the background. The camera view should be from the side of the main guy samurai. Make the image realistic and the main samurai should look western while the other samurai should look like tough asian samurai. Make them very intense in battle and make the sky darker. The title should only say "The Last Samurai".

- **What worked:**  
- **What didn't work:**  
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:** Make me a movie poster of "The Last Samurai" movie. I want to make it feel tragic and tense. I want the main character to be riding a white horse with red samurai armor on and with other samurai behind him also riding horses. They should be in battle. I want the name of the movie to be on the poster. The overall mood should be warm and fast-paced. The characters should be riding up a hill with the samurai in the background. The camera view should be from the side of the main guy samurai. Make the image realistic and the main samurai should look western while the other samurai should look like tough asian samurai. Make them very intense in battle and make the sky darker. The title should only say "The Last Samurai".

- **What worked:**  I liked the general image and feeling
- **What didn't work:**  It was really hard to make letters and there were some parts that looked unnatural.

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  
2.  
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  


**What would you do differently next time?**
